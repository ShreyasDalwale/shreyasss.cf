<p style="padding:50px;word-spacing:5px; margin-top:7% ">Rajasthani architecture is very different from the North Indian architecture and represents an almost ‘West Indian’ tradition.
The features bear a huge resemblance to Gujarati architecture owing to proximity and similar climate .With both regions experiencing extreme weather conditions, with little or no rainfall, there was definitely a need to make homes that keeps you cool during the hot summer months and warm during the biting chill of winters. Though we cannot deny the Mughal influence with many Rajput princesses between married to Moguls and thus bringing some of their culture back home, there is a uniqueness to the way it is portrayed here.</p>

The entrances to the forts and palaces are huge. My first guess was that it was associated with grandeur,
 the larger than life attitude displayed by kings. Later my guide told me that the entrance was meant to 
accommodate elephants during the many processions, both during royal ceremonies like marriage
 (polygamy was the norm for the kings) and equally frequent wars!

<h2> JHAROKHA</h2><div class=img>
<img src="Jharokhas.jpg" width=98% >
<div class=desc><p>
Jharokha’ is a very important feature in Rajasthani architecture. Considering purdah (not permitted for public viewing) 
was important for women in the royal household, this feature allowed them to witness outside events without being 
noticed by outsiders. They are typically balconies covered with a ‘Jaali’. In havelis, usually there is an entire section
 called ‘Zenana’ where women lived separately from the men.
<br><br>
Another functional feature of the Jharokha are the sloping eaves called ‘Chajjas’ that project out above the balconies. 
They protect the building from the heat (can be as high as 50 degrees Celsius in summer) and the slope of the eave help 
in draining out the monsoon rain.
<br><br>
The exteriors of a Jharoka are intricately carved with sculptures of flowers and peacocks. The ostentatious carvings on the
 exteriors represent the culture’s need for ‘display of wealth’. In some smaller havelis, the ornate exteriors camouflage the
 cramped interiors. Historically, each community or region in Rajasthan has tried to outshine the other with displays of bravery, 
beauty and wealth.

<h2>JAALI</h2>

<div class=desc>
<p>
 Covering the Jharokhas are the ‘Jaalis’. These are lattice screens intricately carved in either wood or stone and are prominent 
in most structures, even on balcony railings. Since an open window was not an option owing to security reasons, these screens 
formed the perfect alternative to windows. Most carvings on the Jaalis depict flowers and leaves.
</p></div></div>


<div class=img>

 The Maharajahs (kings) were patrons of art. There were frequent dance performances for entertainment. Dance halls were 
built are part of the fort/palace for this purpose and a lot of attention to detail was paid in making these rooms. Stained Glass
 was imported from Belgium for the windows. Imagine a beautiful dancer swaying away to the tunes of the palace musician. 
The windows can only add a dash of colour to this vibrancy. </p>
</div></div>

<div class=img>
<img src="aalas.jpg" align="left" hspace="12px">
<div class=desc><p>
‘Aalas’ are small niches made in the wall for the placement of diyas (candles). Most of the dance performances were held after
 sunset. In order to light up the dance hall, diyas were lit inside these niches. The light from the diyas was reflected on the mirrored 
ceiling in the room. The room was often referred to as the ‘Moti Mahal’, the Pearl Room for the magical illumination that it created. 
</p></div></div>

<div class=img>
<img src="courtyard.jpg" align="right" hspace="12px">
<div class=desc><p>
Courtyards called as ‘Aangan’ are common in the havelis, the one near the main entrance usually has a fountain in the middle.
The number of courtyards in a haveli determine wealth of the owner. In most havelis, there are atleast 2 courtyards-one each for
 men and women. Women typically use the inner courtyard adjacent to the ‘Zenana’, their living quarters. 
</p></div></div>
<div class=img>
<img src="chhatri.jpg" align="left" hspace="12px">
<div class=desc><p>
The ‘Chhatris’ are called so as they resemble umbrellas and are used to demarcate funeral sites. In some cases, they also act
 as a memorial for royalty. This feature was later copied in all future buildings. In recent structures, they are merely decorative 
and are not associated with memorials. 

Since people no longer live in palaces, the craftsmen here have adapted to the needs of today. The golden yellow stone is sculpted
 into everyday items like glasses, tea light holders and soap cases. While some homes still accommodate the Jharokhas as part of the design, most others incorporate a few features like ornate Jaalis and columns to add a touch of royal living in their homes Each of 
these pieces are hand crafted masterpieces, made by craftsmen who have been making them for generations. Luckily for them, 
there is still a demand for this craft.

The most fascinating feature of Rajasthan is that inspite of all the wars and turmoil, the art, craft and culture in this region has 
lived on. Rajasthan has stood the test of time.<p></div></div>
